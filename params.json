{"name":"Audiovisual steady-state responses: multi-signal congruity and phase effects","tagline":"Visualization, Linear Mixed Modeling, Bayesian analysis of published audiovisual perception experimental data","body":"# Overview\r\n\r\n'Circlipses' is a previously published study between myself and Ariane Rhone (University of Iowa) that involved, blood, sweat, tears, and territorial fights over the keyboard. And also novel stimuli and analyses, resulting in several citations. It was an arduous process, resulting in at least one of us saying we would never be caught doing another audio-visual integration project again. Since that time, we have both learned much more about data and statistical analysis, in addition on how to fit mixed models.\r\n\r\nSo why revisit this? A few reasons:\r\n- more in-depth statistical knowledge\r\n- an opportunity to use advances in Linear Mixed Model (LMM) fitting\r\n- better knowledge of how to fit LMMs\r\n- application of more advanced analyses that are almost never considered in the literature and that may be adopted slowly\r\n\r\nSo to that end, the data and results will be revisited with:\r\n- better summation calls and visualizations\r\n- better distribution plots\r\n- better LMM calls (introducing random slopes mostly)\r\n- analysis of residuals\r\n- Bayesian inference on the dependent variable\r\n\r\nDetails can be found in _**Brain Topography, Vol 24, Issue 2 pp. 134-148**_ (see also the references at the end of the IPython notebook).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
